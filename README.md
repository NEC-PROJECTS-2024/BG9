### INTRODUCTION
Thyroid problems affect people of every generation worldwide and represent a serious global health concern. As a vital component of the endocrine system, the thyroid gland serves as vital for controlling essential metabolic functions that are crucial for overall well-being. Any disruptions or irregularities in thyroid function can result in a range of health complications, from minor discomfort to severe medical conditions [1]. Timely identification and precise thyroid test disorders are required for successful therapy as well as oversight. Conventional diagnostic methods typically involve clinical evaluations and laboratory analyses, which are time-consuming and subjective in nature. However, the emergence of Machine Learning methodologies has transformed healthcare by providing robust tools to enhance diagnostic procedures [2]. Our primary goal is to develop a predictive model capable of identifying individuals who may be predisposed to thyroid disorders. By achieving this, we aim to facilitate early intervention and implement tailored healthcare plans.
